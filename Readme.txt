1. Inside the Boxplot folder are the drawing codes and original data of figure 3b, figure 4b, Supplementary Figure S3b.
2. The Diversity folder is the drawing code and original data of α-diversity and β-diversity in figure 2.
3. Enterotype is also a folder sorted according to the order of the figure: 1) Enterotype in the file of figure 1a is the genus original data and enterotype clustering code for enterotype grouping. The Enterotype_PCA folder is the drawing code for the PCA graph. 2) Figure 1b, c, d folders correspond to the corresponding drawing codes in figure1
4. The ETB_picrust folder corresponds to the ETB picrust analysis code of figure 4b. 1) The lefse folder is the original data and results of the lefse analysis program (https://github.com/SegataLab/lefse), and the analysis process is recorded in batch.txt. 2) The cor_heatmap folder is the original data and code for the correlation analysis between intestinal bacteria and picrust function and heat map drawing.
5. The Graph_abstract folder is the vector image of graph_abstract and figure 6
6. The Machine_learning folder is the code for building the DNN classification model and the original data of each intestinal type.
7. Post Offset Detection PCOA folder is the code and original data of Supplementary Figure S1
8. The Raw_data folder includes 1) fasta.qza (representative sequence) generated after qiime2 analysis, table.qza (representative sequence count), ko_metagenome.qza (ko count table generated by qiime2_picrust plugin). 2) Ncbi_taxonomy .out The characteristic sequence classification table generated by NCBI blast combined with NCBI's 16S ribosomal RNA sequence database (https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/). 3) Calculated bacterial abundance table otu -table.xlsx and feature abundance table ko_result.xlsx.
9. The Species co-occurrence network (SCN) folder is the original data and code of the network analysis of each enterotype. 1) mothur_batch.txt is the analysis process in mothur, and the initial data of the analysis are in each enterotype *.count_table inside the subfile. 2) Each enterotype subfolder contains mothur sparcc analysis result files (*.sparcc_correlation and *.sparcc_pvalue) and cytoscape mapping files *.cys of each enterotype. 3) The cys_net.txt file is the input file of cytoscape, and the cys_group.txt is the node group file of cytoscape.
